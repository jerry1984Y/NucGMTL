# Accurately Identifying Protein-nucleotide Binding Residues via Grouped Multi-task Learning and Pre-trained Protein Language Models

The accurate identification of protein-nucleotide binding residues is crucial for protein function annotation and drug discovery. Numerous computational methods have been proposed to predict these binding residues, achieving remarkable performance. However, due to the limitations in elucidating both the shared and unique binding mechanisms among diverse nucleotides, there remains substantial potential for enhancing predictive performance. To address these challenges, we propose NucGMTL, a novel grouped deep multi-task learning method designed for predicting binding residues of all observed nucleotides in the BioLiP database. NucGMTL leverages pre-trained protein language models to generate robust sequence embedding and incorporates multi-scale learning along with scale-based self-attention mechanisms to capture a broader range of feature dependencies. To effectively harness the shared binding patterns across various nucleotides, deep multi-task learning is utilized to distill common representations, taking advantage of auxiliary information from similar nucleotides selected based on task grouping. Performance evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that NucGMTL achieves an average AUPRC of 0.594, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Further analyses highlight that the primary advantage of NucGMTL lies in its effective integration of grouped multi-task learning and pre-trained protein language models.
